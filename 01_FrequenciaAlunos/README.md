    Aplicação simples mas útil utilizando C# Windows Forms e MetroFramework.

NOTE:

I am using MetroFramework.dll and MetroFramework.Design.dll . If you want to use it i Recommend to change the properties for the Design dll to "Copy local: false" 
as you do not need to redistribute it. This also helps to make your application independent of 
System.Design.dll and compatible with the .NET client profile, a subset of the full .NET framework.
